                        <h3>What is HTML ?</h3>
                        <p>HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means
                            to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.</li>
                            <li>Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.</li>
                            <li>Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for
                                information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.</li>
                            <li>Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in
                                their
                                documents.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language
                            label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so on.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="css_introduction">
                        <h3>What is CSS ?</h3>
                        <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout,
                            and
                            fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large
                            screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any
                            XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain
                            sites,
                            share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is
                            referred to
                            as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.</p>

                        <h1>Overview</h1>
                        <h3>How did HTML generate ?</h3>
                        <p>HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content,
                            in
                            order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The
                            first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0,
                            published
                            in 1995.</p>
                        <img src="./Images/htmlgeneration.jpg" alt="">
                        <h3>Elements and tags :- </h3>
                        <p>HTML uses predefined tags and elements which tell the browser how to properly display the
                            content. Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the
                            opening tag until the end of the page.</p>
                        <img src="./Images/tag.jpg" alt="">
                        <h3>HTML page structure :- </h3>
                        <p>The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential
                            building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements)
                            upon which all web pages are created.</p>
                        <img src="./Images/html.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div id="section3">
                    <div class="child1">
                        <h1>History</h1>
                        <h3><u>!DOCTYPE html:</u> </h3>
                        <p>This is the document type declaration (not technically a tag). It declares a document as
                            being an HTML document. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.</p>
                        <h3><u> Html:</u></h3>
                        <p>This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that
                            it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other
                            elements within it.</p>
                        <h3><u> Head:</u></h3>
                        <p> This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information
                            related to the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a
                            webpage.</p>
                        <h3><u> Body:</u></h3>
                        <p>The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the
                            body content is what the browser will show on the front end.</p>
                        <h2>About CSS</h2>
                        <p>Understanding how your code is organized allows anybody to jump straight into the action from
                            day one. A simple way of doing this is creating a map of your file structure where you can
                            explain what’s in it and what should go where. When doing this pay special attention to
                            those places where there could be ambiguity. For instance, indicating that the file
                            “buttons.css” contains styles for buttons is not very helpful, but indicating that the
                            “custom” directory is where custom styles for the theme are located can be a time saver.</p>

                            <p>As fundamental web development languages HTML and CSS are a great way to get started with
                                development. This is because these languages offer simple sets of rules that define how
                                to code and are easy to learn. In fact, HTML uses a tag-based structure which is easy to
                                understand even without any prior technical experience, CSS uses a simplistic structure
                                as well making the learning curve for mastery relatively easy. </p>
                            <li>Learn other coding languages faster </li>
                            <p>By understanding HTML and CSS, you will soon be able to get a grasp on other technologies
                                much more quickly and easily, these include JavaScript, PHP and SQL and Python. If
                                you’re looking into becoming more serious about web development, knowing the
                                fundamentals is a good place to start and adding additional languages to your skillset
                                arms you with technical advantages and expertise. </p>
                            <li>Build your confidence and craft a new career </li>
                            <p>If you’re looking to start a new career in the world of tech, understanding how different
                                languages work to develop your skills is a necessity. These languages currently power
                                the internet and your favorite websites from Netflix to Google and Facebook all use HTML
                                and CSS, so you will have no trouble finding a company that can utilize your skills.
                                Even if you’re not ready for a career change, upskilling yourself with HTML & CSS can
